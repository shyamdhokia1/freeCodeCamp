# FreeCodeCamp Projects Repository
Overview
Welcome to my FreeCodeCamp Projects Repository! This repository contains the projects I've completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.

Currently I only have two projects here using PostgreSQL to create and query relational databases on World Cup matches and Celestial Bodies.

Acknowledgements
I would like to express my gratitude to FreeCodeCamp for providing an excellent platform for learning web development.
